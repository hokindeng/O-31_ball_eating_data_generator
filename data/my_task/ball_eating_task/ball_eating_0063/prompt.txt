Animate the black ball moving to eat all red balls. The black ball can only eat red balls that are smaller than or equal to its current size. After eating each red ball, the black ball grows larger. Show smooth movement as the black ball approaches each target, the red ball disappearing when eaten, and the black ball growing after each consumption. Continue until all red balls are eaten and only the large black ball remains.
